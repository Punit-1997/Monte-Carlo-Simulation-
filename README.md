# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-
#### Overview of The Repository :
I made this repository for beginner who want to learn Monte - Carlo on your own.This repository help in basic understanding of method and there applicability in the real life problem. I mostly cover the application of monte carlo in different areas Physics such as classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics,but there monte carlo method can be use to model various physical process.
##### Prerequisite for the course:
Basic background in programing skill is enough for learning monte carlo user can choose any languge as per there preference. I will use fortran 90 as programing language for this purpose but user can use any language.
###### Basic Outline of Course : 
Basic of Monte Carlo 

###### Problem where we can apply the monte carlo
1.Totaly Asymetric
